If the request is only partially accepted (i.e. when the server accepts only parts of the data and rejects the rest) the server MUST initialize the `partial_success` field and MUST set the `rejected_\u003csignal\u003e` with the number of items it rejected. Servers MAY also make use of the `partial_success` field to convey warnings/suggestions to senders even when the request was fully accepted. In such cases, the `rejected_\u003csignal\u003e` MUST have a value of `0` and the `error_message` MUST be non-empty. A `partial_success` message with an empty value (rejected_\u003csignal\u003e = 0 and `error_message` = \"\") is equivalent to it not being set/present. Senders SHOULD interpret it the same way as in the full success case."
